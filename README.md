# Windows-Terminal-Theme
A settings json file to apply on your onw windows terminal!
## THIS REPO DOESN'T PROVIDE THE IMAGE TO PUT AS BACKGROUND ON THE TERMINAL
# Things you need:
###### 1. Windows 10 with a build that install Windows terminal
###### 2. File Explorer ( pretty sure you have this one )
###### 3. A cool text editor( if you want to modify the settings and do your own thing)

# How to install:


So for the instalation is pretty simple, you need to install the windows terminal from the Microsoft Store:
<img src="https://github.com/Dom-Juan/Windows-Terminal-Theme/blob/master/Images%20for%20the%20tutorial/img1.png">

Then pressing at the same time: win + r
and write:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState

Press enter, put you background image there:

<img src="https://github.com/Dom-Juan/Windows-Terminal-Theme/blob/master/Images%20for%20the%20tutorial/img3.png">
**Ignore the the cake is a lie.jpg , it's another custom background that i use, you only need your own Terran.png file**

It HAVE to be an image named Terran.png(unless you want to change the settings on the settings.json).

After pasting your png named Terran, go back one folder and enter the folder named LocalState, paste the settings.json here:
<img src="https://github.com/Dom-Juan/Windows-Terminal-Theme/blob/master/Images%20for%20the%20tutorial/img2.png">

You can modify it if you know how code stuff works! just dont forget to access [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/global-settings).


Keep in mind that big or ultra big images will make the terminal also go big or ultra big :p

For further editing i would recommend Microsoft Visual Studio Code with extensions for json files or Sublime Text.
