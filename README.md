# Windows-Terminal-Theme
A settings json file to apply on your onw windows terminal!
## THIS REPO DOESN'T PROVIDE THE IMAGE TO PUT AS BACKGROUND ON THE TERMINAL
# How to install:


So for the instalation is pretty simple, you need to install the windows terminal from the Microsoft Store:


Then pressing at the same time: win + r
and write:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState

Press enter, put you background image here, it HAVE to be an image named Terran.png(unless you want to change more settings on the settings.json).

After pasting your png named Terran, go back one folder and enter the folder named LocalState, paste the settings.json here, you can modify it if you know how code stuff works! just dont forget to access Microsoft documentation(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/global-settings).
